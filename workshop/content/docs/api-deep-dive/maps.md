    an overview of OGC API - Maps standard

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"
    At the completion of the module students will be able to:

    - Explain what the OGC API - Maps standard is
    - Describe what can be done with OGC API - Maps implementations
    - Understand the main resources offered by OGC API - Maps implementations
    - Understand how to retrieve a description of the capabilities of an OGC API - Maps implementation

    - Be able to find an OGC API - Maps endpoint and use it through a client

## Introduction

[OGC API - Maps](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/maps) is a standard that describes an API that presents data as maps by applying a
style.  The standard allows a client application to request maps as images, or change
parameters such as size and coordinate reference systems at the time of request, making them
implementer-friendly and easily understandable by developers without geospatial experience.

!!! note
    This tutorial module is not intended to be a replacement to the actual
    **OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core** standard. The tutorial intentionally
    focuses on a subset of capabilities in order to get the student started
    with using the standard. Please refer to the [**OGC API - Maps - Part 1:
    Core** standard](https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-058/20-058.html) for additional detail.

### Background

> History

  OGC API - Maps standard work was started in 2019.  It has been developed in relation to OGC API - Tiles in
  support of providing both dynamic maps and map tiles.

> Versions

  **OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core** version 1.0.0 is the current latest version

> Test suite

  There are no test suites currently implemented; they will be made available once the specification is
  approved, and an executable test suite (ETS) is made availabe as per of OGC CITE.

> Implementations

  Implementations can be found on the [implementations page](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-maps/blob/master/implementations.adoc).

#### Usage

#### Relation to other standards

OGC Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS): The WMS standard is a long standing and arguably the most well known
and utilized OGC standard.



more appropriate when working with client applications that only support classic OGC Web Services. Note as well that WFS adopts the Geography Markup Language (GML) as a default data format. In contrast, OGC API - Features includes recommendations to support HTML and GeoJSON as encodings, where practical. Implementations of OGC API - Features may also optionally support GML, as well as other vector formats.



### Overview of Resources

**OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core** defines the resources listed in the following table.

!!! note
    This deep dive focuses on the "Collection Maps" Requirement Class of OGC API - Maps.  "Dataset Maps" is not included at this time.

### Example

This [demonstration server](https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master) publishes geospatial data through an interface that conforms to OGC API - Maps.

An example request that can be used to retrieve data from the MapServer WMS demo collection is <https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/collections/mapserver_world_map/map?f=png>

Note that given the scope and purpose of OGC API - Maps, the response to the request is a raw PNG image and not raw data.

for a detailed explanation of an example implementation.

### API Definition

Given OGC API - Maps uses OGC API - Common as a building block, please see the [OGC API - Features](features.md#api-definition) deep dive
for a detailed explanation of an example implementation.

### Collections

Given OGC API - Maps uses OGC API - Common as a building block, please see the [OGC API - Features](features.md#collections) deep dive

OGC API - Maps collection descriptions provide a number of optional properties, including:

- data type: a description of the underlying data supplied by the map (vector, coverage, map)
- min and max scale denominator: minimum and maximum scale denominator for usage of the collection as a map

Below is an extract from the response to the request <https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/collections?f=json>.

}
```

!!! note
    An HTML representation can be viewed if changing `f=html` or not specifying the `f` parameter when working throgh a web browser.

In the `links` array, notice the link with the link relation (`rel`) of `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/map`.  This link
relation informs the client that the link is an OGC API - Maps interface that provides either a default map (`href`) or a map
with various query parameters applied.

### Collection

Given OGC API - Maps uses OGC API - Common as a building block, please see the [OGC API - Features](features.md#collection) deep dive
for a detailed explanation of an example implementation, as well as the [Collections](#collections) description.

To inspect the specific collection, run the request <https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/collections/mapserver_world_map?f=json>.

### Collection maps in the default style

Let generate a map from the collection using the link in the [above](#collections) extract:

<https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/collections/mapserver_world_map/map>

![image](../assets/images/map-world.png){width="80.0%"}

The request above asks the OGC API - Maps server to generate a default map as determined by the server.  In this case,
the default is a map of the world with a pixel width of 500 and height of 300.

Additional parameters can be added to the map URL with specific width, height and area of interest.

To clip the map to a desired area of interest (for example, India), use the **bbox** parameter:

<https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/collections/mapserver_world_map/map?f=png&bbox=69,7,99,37>

To adjust the map's dimensions, use the **width** and **height** parameters:

<https://demo.pygeoapi.io/master/collections/mapserver_world_map/map?f=png&bbox=69,7,99,37&width=800&height=600>

![image](../assets/images/map-india.png){width="80.0%"}

### Collection maps

To demonstrate an OGC API - Maps implementation, [this demonstration server](https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Foundation) provides a list
of styles for a given dataset at <https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Foundation/collections/gtopo30/styles?f=json>.

Each style within the collection can then be requested as a map as follows (using the `colorShaded` and `desaturated` styles):

<https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Foundation/collections/gtopo30/styles/colorShaded/map>

![image](../assets/images/map-gtopo-world-colorshaded.png){width="80.0%"}

<https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Foundation/collections/gtopo30/styles/desaturated/map>

![image](../assets/images/map-gtopo-world-desaturated.png){width="80.0%"}

## Summary

The OGC API - Maps standard describes an API that presents data as maps by applying a style.  This deep dive
provided an overview of the standard and the various Resources and endpoints that are supported.
