# Welcome to the OGC API workshop!

![OGC APIs logo](assets/images/OGC_APIs_banner.jpg)

OGC is globally known for its proven widely implemented open standards. The OGC open consensus-based standards development process has evolved to move at the pace of innovation, with constant input from technology forecasting, practical prototyping, real-world testing, certification and compliance and community engagement. Today we are revolutionizing how geospatial/location information is shared, accessed, integrated, and analyzed via the OGC’s revolutionary APIs- the building blocks for location information.

[OGC APIs](https://ogcapi.ogc.org) are designed to make it easy for ANYONE to provide and use geospatial data on the web, and to integrate this data with ANY other type of information. These Standards build upon the legacy of the OGC Web Service Standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, etc.), but define resource-centric APIs that take advantage of modern web development practices. This web page provides information on these Standards in a consolidated location.

These Standards are being constructed as "building blocks" that can be used to assemble novel APIs for web access to geospatial content. The building blocks are defined not only by the requirements of the Standards specified in the [OGC's Standards Program](https://www.ogc.org/standards), but also through interoperability prototyping and testing in the [OGC's Collaborative Solutions and Innovation Program](https://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/programs/ip).

# About this workshop

This workshop provides a combination of concepts, presentation and exercises of OGC APIs in support of discovery, access, visualization and processing in support of FAIR data principles.

Each deep dive module starts with an "Audience" and "Learning Objectives" sections:

!!! abstract Audience
    Describes what this module is about.

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"
    Describes what students should be able to do, after the completion of the module.

Exercises are indicated as follows:

!!! question "Example exercise"

    A section marked like this indicates that you can try out the exercise.

Also you will notice notes sections within the text:

!!! note

    Highlights some important aspect.

Examples are indicated as follows:

Bash shell
``` bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://myrequest.com'
```

JSON
``` json
{
    "title": "my cool collection title",
    "description": "my cool collection description"
}
```
