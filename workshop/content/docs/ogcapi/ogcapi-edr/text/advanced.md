# Query Resources of OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval


Query resources are spatio-temporal queries which support operation of
the API for the access and use of the spatio-temporal data resources.

Query resources share several common parameters, which makes it easier
for developers to implement the queries.

Where the query applies to a collection, the pattern is as follows:

```/collections/{collectionId}/{queryType}```

The parameter ```queryType``` can be one of the following:

-   position
-   area
-   cube
-   trajectory
-   corridor
-   radius
-   instances
-   locations
-   items

Where the query applies to an instance, the pattern is as follows:

```/collections/{collectionId}/instances/{instanceId}/{queryType}```
